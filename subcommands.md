## config

Lists the current configuration for _noted_. This is the combination of default values plus whatever is found in `$HOME/.notedconfig`, where values
in `$HOME/.notedconfig` take precedence.

### Synopsis

```shell
noted config  
```

### Overview

The config subcommand will:

- Generate a quick view of the resulting configuration after applying the values in `$HOME/.notedconfig`

### Arguments & Flags

N/A

### Examples

View configuration:

```shell
noted config
```

## create

Create a new note.

### Synopsis

```shell
noted create [Quoted text to use (optional)] [ALTERNATE_FILE_NAME (optional)] 
```

### Overview

The create subcommand will:

- Look for a file named with today's date, and create it if it doesn't exist
- Append the note template to the file named with today's date, with the current timestamp
- Open the file named with today's date
- Position the cursor in the entry title field

> **Important:**
>
> We encourage users to omit `create` and use the alternate shorthand `noted` without the create keyword. The remainder
> of this documentation will use the shorthand.

### Arguments & Flags

Both arguments are optional. When quoted text is included the text will automatically be appended to the entry and editing of the entry will be skipped. When
the `ALTERNATE_FILE_NAME` argument is supplied with a filename, then instead of using the automatic file (named with today's date), the file supplied will be
used.

### Examples

Start a new entry:

```shell
noted
```

Add a new note with the text "This is a quick note" as the title and an empty body:

```shell
noted "This is a quick note"
```

Start a new entry in the file named `process.md`:

```shell
noted 'Some note' process.md
```

## edit / view

Open a specific note file, or today's file if no file is specified, in the default editor.

### Synopsis

```shell
noted edit [FILE (optional)] 
```

```shell
noted view [FILE (optional)] 
```

### Overview

Edit and view are interchangeable.

The edit / view subcommand will:

- Look for the file passed as an argument
- If no file is passed, then it will assume today's file
- Open the given file in the default editor

> NOTE:
> Edit is different than create. Create will also populate a new note entry into the given file using the template.
> Edit, on the other hand, will merely open the file.

### Arguments & Flags

The `FILE` argument is optional. You should not include the extension. The Markdown extension `.md` is assumed.

### Examples

Open today's file in the default editor.

```shell
noted edit
```

Open the file from 2021-10-01:

```shell
noted edit 2021-10-01
```

Open a file named `process.md`:

```shell
noted view process
```

## grep

Shortcut for running a recursive grep in your configured notes directory.

### Synopsis

```shell
noted grep [ARGUMENTS (optional)] [SEARCH_TERM (required)] 
```

### Overview

Runs `grep -r [NOTED_MARKDOWN_HOME]` and also passes along any arguments you supply.

> REMINDER:
> `$NOTED_MARKDOWN_HOME` is configured to `$HOME/Documents/notes` by default but can be overridden in the `$HOME/.notedconfig` file. See the [configuration guide](README.md#configuration-guide) for more.

### Arguments & Flags

Any arguments that grep accepts can be passed.

### Examples

Perform a case-insensitive search for the term "Java." 

```shell
noted grep -i java
```

Perform a search for "Jenkins" and show line numbers:

```shell
noted grep Jenkins -n
```

## open

Opens the `$NOTED_MARKDOWN_HOME` directory in VS Code.

### Synopsis

```shell
noted open 
```

### Overview

Opens the configured directory in VS Code, so it is easier to navigate through the notes.
It is recommended to change the following variable in VS Code: `"window.newWindowDimensions": "maximized"`

### Arguments & Flags

N/A

### Examples

Open the notes directory:

```shell
noted open
```

## todos

Lists any todos that you have previously saved in your notes.

### Synopsis

```shell
noted todos 
```

### Overview

Runs a recursive grep in your configured notes directory for the value configured in `NOTED_TODO_MARKER`, excluding
results that contain strikethrough text (markdown value of `~~`) as a means of detecting "crossed-out" todo items.

> REMINDER:
> `NOTED_TODO_MARKER` is configured to `TODO` by default but can be overridden in the `$HOME/.notedconfig` file. See the [configuration guide](README.md#configuration-guide) for more.

### Arguments & Flags

N/A

### Examples

View any TODO items that are not crossed-out:

```shell
noted todos
```

## version

View the current version of `noted`.

### Synopsis

```shell
noted version 
```

### Overview

### Arguments & Flags

### Examples

```shell
noted version
```
